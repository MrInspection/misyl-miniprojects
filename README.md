# Mini Projects (Internship)

This repository contains a collection of mini projects that I have worked on during my internship at [Misyl Serivces SAS](https://misyl.net/). The aim of those projects was to learn new technologies that were not familiar to me, and to apply them in a practical way. And from what I learn to be able to work on the real projects during my internship.

> These projects are not meant to be used as a reference or a starting point for your own projects. They are meant to be used as a way to learn new technologies and to practice your skills in a practical way. But if you find them useful, that's great!
